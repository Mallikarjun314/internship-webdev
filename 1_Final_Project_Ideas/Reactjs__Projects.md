# Reactjs Projects

## 1. **Task Manager Application** ⭐

Build a multi-page Task Manager using React. Users should be able to create, edit, and delete tasks with tags and deadlines. The app must allow filtering tasks by tags or completion status. Each task should have its own detail page. Use state to manage tasks and persist them using `localStorage`.



## 2. **Student Management System** ⭐

Create a system to manage student information such as name, class, and marks. Include pages for listing all students, viewing individual profiles, and adding/editing details. Implement filtering by class and display performance using visual elements (like charts). Use React state and routing to manage views and updates.



## 3. **E-commerce Product Frontend** ⭐

Develop a frontend for an e-commerce app that displays products, allows users to add them to a cart or wishlist, and view item details. Create multiple pages for the homepage, product detail, cart, and wishlist. Maintain cart and wishlist state across pages using `useContext` or `props`.



## 4. **Music Playlist Manager**

Design a music app where users can browse a list of songs, view song details, and create playlists. Each playlist should allow adding/removing songs. Implement search functionality and routing between different views. Use state variables to manage playlists and current playback.



## 5. **Event Scheduler and Calendar App**

Build an event scheduling application where users can create, edit, and view events on a calendar. Include a page for creating events and another for viewing the details. Use date pickers, event lists, and manage all events using React state. Bonus: Implement event reminders or color-coded categories.



## 6. **Flashcard Study Tool** 

Create a flashcard-based study tool. Users can create decks of flashcards and flip them to view answers. Include a study mode that tracks the number of correct answers. Each deck should be managed via state and be viewable on a separate page. Route between deck listing, deck view, and study mode.



## 7. **News Aggregator App**

Develop a React app that fetches and displays news articles from a public news API. Include filtering by category and keyword search. Display headlines on the home page and full articles on detail pages. Use state for category selection and search term storage, and handle API errors gracefully.



## 8. **Photo Gallery Viewer**

Build a photo gallery using the Unsplash API. The homepage should show a grid of photos with a search bar to find images by keywords. Clicking a photo should open it in full view or a modal. Use React state to handle fetched data and search input, and `useEffect` for API calls.



## 9. **Weather Forecast Dashboard**

Create a weather dashboard where users can search for a city to get the current weather and 7-day forecast. Include a toggle for °C/°F and pages for viewing weather details of different cities. Use the OpenWeatherMap API and manage state for temperature unit, city, and forecast data.



## 10. **User Profile Editor**

Design an application that displays a user’s profile and allows editing it. Include fields like name, email, bio, and profile picture. Users should be able to update and preview their profile. Implement forms with validation and use React state to manage profile data.



## 11. **Quiz Application** ⭐

Build a quiz application with multiple-choice questions. Users can start a quiz, answer questions one by one, and view their final score. Add features like a timer for each question and a results page. Use state to track current question, selected answers, and score.



## 12. **Unit Converter** ⭐

Develop a converter for units such as length, weight, and temperature. Users should select a conversion category, input a value, and see the converted result. Add a page for viewing past conversions. Manage category selection, input/output values, and conversion history using state.


## 13. **Hotel Booking System** ⭐

Develop a Hotel Booking System using React.js that allows users to search, view, and book rooms in a hotel. The application should consist of multiple pages, manage various types of state (form data, selections, filters, etc.), and simulate booking functionality. Though the backend/API can be mocked (optional), the app should mimic real-world functionality with interactive UI and dynamic state management.

## 14. **Online Food Ordering System** ⭐

Build an Online Food Ordering System using React.js where users can browse a restaurant's menu, add items to their cart, customize orders, and place a food order. The app must use React Router for multi-page navigation and manage global and local states for cart, menu filters, and order processing. While a backend is not required, you should use dummy/mock data and persist orders using localStorage.
